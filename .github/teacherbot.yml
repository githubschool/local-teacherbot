    Hi @${issueOwner}! I'm the friendly :robot: of the GitHub Training Team.

    We're happy you're here :wave:. Everyone is welcome here, so I'm making you a collaborator. This will give you access to commit on this repo. Continue with the [instructions](https://services.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/explore-github-repository).

    If this isn't what you were hoping to get help with, just leave another note in this issue, and a hu-man trainer will drop by within 24 hours to answer your questions!

    I can see that you're already a collaborator. Any other issues are above my paygrade at the moment, so we'll have to wait for a pesky hu-man trainer. Not to worry though, they'll drop by within 24 hours to answer your questions!
